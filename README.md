### Project Description

This is a game of tic-tac-toe that you can play with your friend sitting next to you. The header displays whether it is Player X's turn or Player O's turn. The game can be finished from each player winning, or a draw. A new game is generated with the player who lost the game before. The project Spec is found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/tic-tac-toe-solo-v2.html) and has a video along with it.

### Learning Goals

* Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
  * DRY JavaScript
  * event delegation to handle similar event listeners
* Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
* Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
* Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

### Wins

* Completed all functionality of project spec with no bugs. 
* Used minimal outside resources to complete. 
* Refactored to manipulate data model witout the DOM elements. 

### Challenges

* Resetting the game with the losing player to start. 
* Manipulating the DOM to create a blank game.
